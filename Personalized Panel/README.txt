In this project, we experiment with Nodejs emitters and create Jquery Mobile menus! 

You need to have Node.js and jQuery along with the following files before you can run this application 

-These files MUST be in the same directory
*index.html
*calculator.js
*weather.js
*server.js

-This file is the API key and MUST be in the parent directory (to prevent unauthorized access to it)
*wundergroundkey.txt

To run the application, open the command line and navigate to the directory that contains server.js and run the command 'node server.js' without the quotes. Then open up a browser and type in the URL 'localhost:8080' without the quotes. Index.html will be displayed as the main page and you can navigate through different pages by clicking on the links presented on the jQuery mobile menu.
